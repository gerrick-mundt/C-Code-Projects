Welcome to the C-Code- wiki!

This repository will be used to familiarize myself with the C Coding language in support of my embedded systems projects [baremetal-embedded-systems-C-ATmega328P-Portfolio](https://github.com/gerrick-mundt/baremetal-embedded-systems-C-ATmega328P-Portfolio).

These are 40 projects that I intend to do:

| | 2. Bank Account Simulator | Deposit/withdraw amount, account number | Updated balance, transaction logs | Simulates simple account operations. |
| | 3. Hangman Game | Letter guesses | Display of guessed letters, remaining attempts | User guesses letters of a word until solved or attempts run out. |
| | 4. Tic-Tac-Toe | Player moves (row/col) | Board updates, winner | Two-player game; checks for wins/draws. |
| | 5. Inventory System | Item name, quantity, price | Inventory list, total value | Tracks items and computes total inventory value. |
| | 6. Text-Based Menu System | User menu choice | Selected option executed | Demonstrates structured control flow via menus. |
| | 7. Simple File Editor | Text input | Saved file | Reads/writes text files, append or overwrite content. |
| | 8. Vigenère Cipher Encoder/Decoder | Plaintext, key | Ciphertext or decoded text | Encrypts/decrypts text using the Vigenère cipher. |
| | 9. Matrix Operations | Matrix elements | Sum, product, transpose | Performs basic matrix operations. |
| | 10. Calendar Generator | Year, month | Displayed calendar | Prints a monthly calendar. |
| **Advanced** | 1. Chatbot (Console-based) | User input text | Bot response | Responds to user queries with pre-defined patterns. |
| | 2. Banking System with File Persistence | Account info, transactions | Updated balances, history | Stores data persistently in files. |
| | 3. Mini Shell / Command Interpreter | Command strings | Command output | Executes basic shell commands. |
| | 4. Sudoku Solver | 9x9 Sudoku grid | Completed grid | Solves Sudoku using backtracking. |
| | 5. Text Search Engine | Text corpus, search query | Matching lines/words | Searches text files for keywords. |
| | 6. Maze Generator and Solver | Maze size | Displayed maze, solution path | Generates random maze and finds a path from start to end. |
| | 7. Student Database with Sorting & Searching | Student records | Sorted list, search results | Allows sorting/searching by name or score. |
| | 8. Expense Tracker | Income, expenses | Summary, remaining budget | Tracks expenses and shows monthly report. |
| | 9. File Compression Tool | Text file | Compressed file | Implements simple compression (e.g., RLE). |
| | 10. Conway’s Game of Life | Initial grid state | Next generation grids | Simulates cellular automaton based on simple rules. |
| **Expert** | 1. Mini Compiler / Interpreter | Source code in simple language | Execution results or errors | Parses and executes a tiny language. |
