Welcome to the C-Code- README!

This repository will be used to expand my knowledge of the C Coding language in support of my embedded systems projects [baremetal-embedded-systems-C-ATmega328P-Portfolio](https://github.com/gerrick-mundt/baremetal-embedded-systems-C-ATmega328P-Portfolio).

All source and header files for projects done here are can be found in this code directory.

These are 40 projects that I intend to do:
