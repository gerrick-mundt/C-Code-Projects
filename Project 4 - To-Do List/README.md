# Project 4: To-Do List
## Overview/Purpose
This program implements a simple to-do list capable of storing up to 50 items, with each item containing up to 100 characters. The user can iteratively enter list items, one per line, until they have finished entering their tasks. Entering either `0` or pressing **Enter** on an empty line ends the input process, after which the program displays the complete to-do list.

This project strengthened my understanding of standard library functions from both `<stdio.h>` and `<string.h>`, particularly for handling user input and string manipulation.
